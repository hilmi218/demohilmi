## What is Refine?

**Refine** is a meta **React** framework that enables the rapid development of a wide range of web applications. From internal tools, admin panels, B2B apps and dashboards, it serves as a comprehensive solution for building any type of **CRUD** applications.

Refine's internal hooks and components simplifies the development process and eliminates the repetitive tasks by providing industry-standard solutions for crucial aspects of a project, including **authentication**, **access control**, **routing**, **networking**, **state management**, and **i18n**.

Here's an overview of the Refine structure:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
const App = () => (
  <Refine
    dataProvider={dataProvider}
    resources={[
      {
        name: "blog_posts",
        list: "/blog-posts",
        show: "/blog-posts/show/:id",
        create: "/blog-posts/create",
        edit: "/blog-posts/edit/:id",
      },
    ]}
  >
    /* ... */
  </Refine>
);
```

⚡ **Refine** is _headless by design_ and offers unlimited styling and customization possibilities, empowering developers to create tailored and fully functional applications that meet specific project requirements.

Utilizing integrated technologies you can efforlessly develop industry-standard CRUD applications with **Refine**.

## What do you mean by "headless" ?

Instead of being limited to a set of pre-styled components, **Refine** provides collections of helper `hooks`, `components` and `providers` and more. Since business logic and UI are completely decoupled, you can customize UI without constraints.

It means, **Refine** just works _seamlessly_ with any _custom designs_ or _UI frameworks_. Thanks to it's headless architecture, you can use popular CSS frameworks like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or even create your own styles from scratch.

Refine also provides integrations with [Ant Design](https://ant.design/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/), [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) to get you started quickly. These libraries are set of components which are nicely integrated with headless `@refinedev/core` package.

### Headless in Routing

For the routing, Refine's headless approach shines too. It doesn't tie you to a single routing method or library. Instead, it offers a simple routing interface with built-in integrations for popular libraries.

This means you can use Refine seamlessly in different platforms like React Native, Electron, Next.js, Remix etc. without any extra steps for the setup.

## Use cases

**Refine** shines when it comes to _data-intensive_ applications like _admin panels_, _dashboards_ and _internal tools_.
